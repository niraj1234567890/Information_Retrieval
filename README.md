# Information_Retrieval
## Extract information from a text document using spacy language model:

* When we want to use a specific information from a large text document, we need to have an algorithm that retrieves information. The Spacy language model provides some useful functionalities to do that.
1. I scraped a text data from wikipedia page of Delhi city(India) and used it as a main text document for inforamtion retrieval.
2. After preprocessing the wikipedia page, I applied spacy language model to parse our text document so that we can use it further for information retrieval.
3. Then I used textacy model over spacy to extract sentences regarding Delhi city containing verb 'be' and 'have'.
